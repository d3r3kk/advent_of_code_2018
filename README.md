# Advent of Code 2018

I decided to do this for the December 2018 Advent of Code, as part of my work commitment to ensure I spent more time learning Python.

All samples are taken from the Advent of Code website, none of that is my own. Only the coded solutions are mine, their quality such as it is...

# Day 1

Run the code in the `day_1` folder like so:

`cd [this_workspace]`
`py -3.7 .\day_1\chronal_calibration\chronal_calibration.py`

You should get exactly this output:

```cmd
PS D:\dev\github\d3r3kk\aoc18> py -3.7 .\day_1\chronal_calibration\chronal_calibration.py
Recalibration frequency is 402
First repeating frequency is 481
```

# Day 2
